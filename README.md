# ComputationalGeom
A collection of python files that were used to test implementation of a high dimensional polygon geometry problem 

No particular objective for each of these codes. Hull generator tries to create a non convex hull given a set of n dimensional vectors. Plane generator generates a hyperplane that is routinely used in the algorithm. Vector visualizer just shows the path a vector took.
